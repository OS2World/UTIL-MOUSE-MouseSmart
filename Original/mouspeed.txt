MOUSPEED.EXE                                                23.Marz 1995   

This small program improves the speed/quickness of the mouse pointer
in PM/WPS for OS/2 (only tested under Warp).  It will perform in an OS/2
text window.  It is best entered in STARTUP.CMD.

I have compiled this at the request of STARTER@hannover.bybyte.de

To obtain a bit more flexibility, I have integrated command line
parameters.

Therefore, you can quickly and simply determine the command line values.  A
short syntax pointer as well as the old and new command line values will be
shown; however, these command line values are not needed.

An example of the sytax reads:
  MOUSPEED 3 2 20 4 == these are my examples of the slow standard values
  MOUSPEED 5 2 10 5 == these are the default values of the original source
  MOUSPEED 10 2 10 8 == makes the mouse movement correct

The archive contains the subsequent files:
  LIESMICH.TXT  (README.TXT)
  MOUSPEED.EXE  (only the .EXE file will be required for operation)
  MOU.C         (original Source)
  MOUSPEED.C    (modified source)

A copyright reference isn't given.  This is Freeware -- make of it what
you will.

This small program originates from my inquiry about a faster mouse
driver in the OS2GER forum.  In that forum, Oliver Ludwig (100065,1743) found
an answer in C-source code taken from Peter Fitzimmons.  I don't own an OS/2
compiler, so I have asked Andreas Just (Scorpio) in my local e-mail system
(HANNOVER BY BYTE) to take over this part.  He has made and is still making,
improvements to the code.  The results are as seen above.

Please note that the ZIP file I obtained did not include the MOU.C file as
indicated above.  As of 1/26/96, the original file had been downloaded (and
hopefully used) from the OS2USER forum on Compuserve by 218.  This file
replaces the previously uploaded ZIP file, but its contents are the same
except for this file.  I like the setting MOUSPEED 10 2 10 8:  It works very
well for me at 1024x768 resolution.
